Machine learning for physical systems, with an emphasis on geometric structure.

## About

I work on machine learning models for physical systems, with a focus on
geometric representations, symmetry, and physical inductive biases.

My research focuses on developing and analyzing machine learning models
and methods that respect and exploit geometric structure,
particularly in physical regimes where it plays a central role.

I am currently a Research Scientist at PhysicsX. Previously, I worked as a
Machine Learning Scientist at Microsoft Quantum and completed a PhD on
geometric and equivariant machine learning for molecular systems.
